title: "Project 4: Analysis Of Factors Affecting Coconut Production In Lumajang Regency, East Java, Indonesia, Using Rapid Miner"
---

* Business Understanding: Lumajang Regency is one of the areas in the southern part of East Java Province, Indonesia. Lumajang Regency has considerable potential in the agricultural, plantation, and other sectors. In the plantation sector, the most extensive use of the area in Lumajang Regency in 2021 is the Coconut harvested area of 7,939 ha with a production yield of 8,259.78 tons. Then followed by 3,962.5 hectares of robusta coffee plantations with a production of 1,312.29 tons. Based on these data, the potential for plantations in Lumajang Regency, especially Coconut, is very large. Our Data Science team will help determine what factors can affect coconut production, which can later be used as material for evaluating the Lumajang Regency Government, production efficiency, increasing production, and increasing people's income.

* Data Understanding: The dataset used contains the Year of Production, Immature Plants, Mature Plants, Damaged Plants, Total Land Area (Ha), and Productivity.

* Data Preparation: The data used does not include all the columns in the dataset. Some variables that will not use in the filter first. Then the dataset used is a dataset that only contains variables: Immature Plants, Mature Plants, Damaged Plants, Total Land Area (Ha), and Productivity.

* Modelling: The algorithm used to analyze this dataset is the Correlation Matrix. A Correlation Matrix is used to analyze and determine the relationship between variables in a dataset. Later, we can also find out what factors can affect coconut production.

* Evaluation: The attribute (factor) that has the most significant effect (positive relationship) on coconut production is the mature plant. Attribute (factor) that has a positive relationship but is pretty low in coconut production is Total Land Area (Ha). Other attributes (factors) have no relationship or correlation with coconut production.

* Deployment: Based on the analysis results, we as Data Scientists try to offer solutions to Lumajang Government for Deployment or implementation. Our solutions focus on the care of Mature Plants, such as Plant sanitation, weed control, fertilization, and others. Then, holding special training on coconut commodity maintenance with speakers who are experts in their fields. Finally, re-evaluate if there is an expansion of land for coconut production because the amount of land area has a low impact on coconut production.
