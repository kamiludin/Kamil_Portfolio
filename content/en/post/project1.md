title: "Project 1: Country Clustering Analysis"
---

* The project analyzes data from the HELP International Organization, where Chief Executive Officers need to decide how to use their money strategically and effectively. So, the Chief Executive Officer must decide to select the countries most in need of assistance. The purpose of this analysis is to categorize countries using the socioeconomic and health factors that determine the country's overall development.

* After understanding the data, I did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which consisted of Handling Missing Value, Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, and Multivariate Analysis.

* After Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I do Data Preprocessing, namely Handling Outliers and Feature Scaling or change the range of each feature so that it has the same range of values. Besides that, I also make Feature Selection so that I can find out which features are useful and in accordance with the purpose of this analysis.

* Then, I did Clustering using the K-Means algorithm and didn't forget Visualization to understand the processed data. In addition, I also checked how well the Clustering model that had been created was using several methods, namely the Elbow Method and the Silhouette Score.

* After that, I will show which countries are eligible and need help from this International HELP Organization.
