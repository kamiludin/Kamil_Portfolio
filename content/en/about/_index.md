I'm Ahmad Kamiludin, a final student majoring in Islamic Economics at the State Islamic University of KH Achmad Siddiq Jember, East Java, Indonesia. Has experience in various organizations, studies and research in the fields of economics and business, and has worked on Data Analyst/Data Science Projects. I have an interest in a career as a Data Analyst / Data Scientist and quite proficient in using several tools, such as Microsoft Office Tools, Python Language, Statistics, and Tableau for visualization, so I'm also interested in working in the field of Data Analyst / Data Scientist as a benchmark and implementation of the knowledge that I have studied so far.
